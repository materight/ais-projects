### Exercise 1
- **What happens if you make λ smaller e.g. λ = μ?** \
By decreasing λ we obtain an overall better (i.e. lower) fitness value and the convergence speed is faster.

- **What happens if you increase the mixing number ρ?** \
By increasing the mixing number ρ, the overall fitness is better (lower) and the convergence speed is faster.

- **Try out the different strategy modes and observe how they affect the performance of the algorithm** \
The results shows that with a ρ=1, between None, Global and Individual, Global gives the better results. However, if we increase the value of ρ, e.g. ρ=5, the Individual strategy obtain the best performance overall.

### Exercise 2

- **How does the self-adaptation strategy influence performance on this problem?** \
As mentioned before, None, Global and Individual obtain increasingly better results (in this order) with a ρ=5.

- **Does what you see here confirm what you suspected from the previous exercise?** \

- **How do the values of μ, ρ, and λ influence the performance given a particular self-adaptation strategy and other parameters?** \

- **Can you come up with any rules of thumb for choosing these parameters?** \

- **Can you find a choice of parameters that work properly across several problems?** \
