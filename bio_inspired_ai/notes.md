### Exercise 1
- **What happens if you make λ smaller e.g. λ = μ?** \
By decreasing λ we obtain an overall better (i.e. lower) fitness value and th convergence speed is faster
 
- **What happens if you increase the mixing number ρ?** \
df

- **Try out the different strategy modes and observe how they affect the performance of the algorithm** \

### Exercise 2

- **How does the self-adaptation strategy influence performance on this problem?** \

- **Does what you see here confirm what you suspected from the previous exercise?** \

- **How do the values of μ, ρ, and λ influence the performance given a particular self-adaptation strategy and other parameters?** \

- **Can you come up with any rules of thumb for choosing these parameters?** \

- **Can you find a choice of parameters that work properly across several problems?** \
